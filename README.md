# DGT-AR: Visualizing Code Dependencies in Augmented Reality

Welcome to the **DGT-AR** project! This Unity application is designed to visualize code dependencies in immersive augmented reality (AR). It aims to enhance the software development process by extending the physical screen space of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) to a virtual environment.

## 🚀 Features

- **Node-Link Visualization**: Visualize code dependencies as nodes and links, making it easier to understand relationships and structure.
- **Immersive AR Experience**: Leverage augmented reality to view code dependencies in a 3D space.
- **Interactive Controls**: Navigate through dependencies with intuitive gestures and interactions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and effective UI for an enhanced user experience.

## 🧠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2021.3 or later
- AR Foundation and ARKit/ARCore packages installed
- A compatible AR device (e.g., iOS device with ARKit or Android device with ARCore)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DGT-AR.git
2.	Open the project in Unity.
3.	Ensure all necessary packages (AR Foundation, ARKit, ARCore) are installed via the Package Manager.
4.	Set up the AR session in the Main scene.
5.	Deploy to your AR-enabled device.

## 📈 Usage

1.	Launch the application on your AR device.
2.	Point the camera at a flat surface to anchor the AR experience.
3.	Interact with nodes to explore code dependencies.
